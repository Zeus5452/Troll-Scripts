USSR Anthem
Soyuz nerushimyy respublik svobodnykh
Splotila naveki Velikaya Rus'.
Da zdravstvuyet sozdannyy voley narodov
Yedinyy, moguchiy Sovetskiy Soyuz!

Slav'sya, Otechestvo nashe svobodnoye,
Druzhby narodov nadozhnyy oplot!
Partiya Lenina - sila narodnaya
Nas k torzhestvu kommunizma vedot!

Skvoz' grozy siyalo nam solntse svobody,
I Lenin velikiy nam put' ozaril,
Na pravoye delo on podnyal narody,
Na trud i na podvigi nas vdokhnovil.

Slav'sya, Otechestvo nashe svobodnoye,
Druzhby narodov nadozhnyy oplot!
Partiya Lenina - sila narodnaya
Nas k torzhestvu kommunizma vedot!

V pobede bessmertnykh idey kommunizma
My vidim gryadushcheye nashey strany
I Krasnomu znameni slavnoy Otchizny
My budem vsegda bezzavetno verny!

Slav'sya, Otechestvo nashe svobodnoye,
Druzhby narodov nadozhnyy oplot!
Partiya Lenina - sila narodnaya
Nas k torzhestvu kommunizma vedot!

*English Lyrics:*

Unbreakable Union of freeborn Republics,
Great Russia has welded forever to stand.
Created in struggle by will of the people,
United and mighty, our Soviet land!

Sing to the Motherland, home of the free,
Bulwark of peoples in brotherhood strong.
O Party of Lenin, the strength of the people,
To Communism's triumph lead us on!

Through tempests the sunrays of freedom have cheered us,
Along the new path where great Lenin did lead.
To a righteous cause he raised up the peoples,
Inspired them to labour and valourous deed.

Sing to the Motherland, home of the free,
Bulwark of peoples in brotherhood strong.
O Party of Lenin, the strength of the people,
To Communism's triumph lead us on!

In the victory of Communism's immortal ideal,
We see the future of our dear land.
And to her fluttering scarlet banner,
Selflessly true we always shall stand!

Sing to the Motherland, home of the free,
Bulwark of peoples in brotherhood strong.
O Party of Lenin, the strength of the people,
To Communism's triumph lead us on!
