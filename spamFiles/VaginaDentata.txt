Dear Tychy.

The recent release of the film Teeth has 
finally given me the
confidence to talk openly about
my condition,
and I believe that the readers 
of your website will provide a
sympathetic audience for my story.
Since pubescence, I have suffered
from vagina dentata:
a rare medical condition in 
which my vagina is filled with rows
of sharp, gnashing teeth.
The stigma associated with 
my condition means that I am often
subjected to terrible discrimination.
The most distressing feature 
of my affliction is that whenever I
meet dogs in the street, 
my vagina begins to bark excitedly,
which often provokes very 
cruel remarks from bystanders. 
There was a
period, or rather a phase,
during my late teenaged years
when my vagina decided to 
become a vegetarian – allowing me a brief
window in which I could
enjoy normal sexual relationships –
but my vagina quickly 
tired of munching upon 
quiche and stuffed
peppers, and it soon reverted
back to its customary behaviour.

I have been fortunate to have 
a very sweet male friend who has
provided me with a great 
deal of support.
We had dated as teenagers,
and despite my vagina 
eating some of
his penis, we remained 
close companions,
even though our relationship 
could only ever be plutonic.
Last week, however, 
my friend invited me out for
dinner and he insinuated 
that the evening would
end romantically.
I was uncertain of this,
and so during dinner I made sure 
that my vagina had a good steak
and lots of potatoes, followed
by a hearty pudding,
so that it would be too 
full to have any
appetite for my friend’s advances.
Yet when we were finally
in each others’ arms, my friend revealed
that he had dressed his penis in
what could only be described 
as a little customised suit of armour.
During intercourse there was a
frightful racket and 
afterwards I found,
upon examination, that
the teeth of 
my vagina were bleeding.
I always brush my teeth 
very thoroughly to avoid unnecessary trips
to the dentist – he always kicks up a
fuss about checking my teeth
– but I had no alternative but to make
an appointment this time.
The dentist removed several of my teeth, 
and he warned that in
future I may have to wear false teeth.
This may ultimately be a good thing, 
because then I would be able
to remove them before intercourse.
I hope that sharing my story may 
provide strength for other
sufferers of vagina dentata and I urge
them to check out this website 
which I have established for
those with teethed vaginas.

Yours Sincerely.

Miss Penelope Triste.
