Baby shark!

I didn't think that I would die today.
They smelled my bleeding wounds a mile away.
It won't be long. They keep a steady pace.
The ocean floor will be my resting place.
Now I can faintly hear those sirens sing.
My life is hanging from the thinnest string, the thinnest string.
They move in packs. Now they've surrounded me.
Not one or two; it's a whole family.
